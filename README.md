# Rice leaf diseased
This GitHub repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting rice leaf diseases. The model was trained on a dataset of 7420 images, which includes five classes: Bacterialblight, Blast, Brownspot, Healthy, and Tungro. The data was split into 80% training, 10% validation, and 10% testing sets.

The trained model achieved an impressive accuracy of 100% and is capable of accurately predicting the different classes of rice leaf diseases. The model architecture and training process are detailed in the repository, along with the necessary code and data for replicating the results.

The successful implementation of this model highlights its potential for accurate detection and diagnosis of rice leaf diseases, which can help in the early prevention and control of crop damage. This repository serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in developing similar models for plant disease detection.
